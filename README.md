Cute little game written in python using the module pygame. Made in April 2019.

The DOWNLOAD file has a link to an installer for the game as an .exe. (It has only been tested on Windows 10.)

If you wish to download the .py file and its dependencies, in order for the game to work:
1.) All the files in "audio_2" must be added to the folder "audio" once downloaded. You can then delete the audio_2 folder, it is not used     for anything.
2.) You'll also have to rename "KylaAlfredo_compressed" to simply "KylaAlfredo".
